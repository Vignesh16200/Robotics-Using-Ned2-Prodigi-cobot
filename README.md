# Robotics-Using-Ned2-Prodigi-cobot


The combined functionality of the pick-and-place process, conveyor system, and IR sensor demonstrates the efficiency and autonomy achieved in the chocolate handling process. The proposed system can find practical applications in the confectionery industry, where automated pick-and-place processes are sought after to optimize production and reduce human involvement in repetitive tasks. Additionally, this project showcases the potential of ROS as a versatile and robust platform for controlling robotic systems with various sensors, making it a valuable contribution to the field of robotics and automation.
